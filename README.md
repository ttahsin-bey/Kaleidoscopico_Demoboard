# Demoboard for LFT's Demo "Kaleidoscopico"



Demos always look better on real hardware. That's what everyone says.



That's why I designed this small circuit board for myself, so that I can run LFT's demo on real hardware instead of just watching it on YouTube.I didn't want to build his version on a stripboard, but preferred a clean solution with SMT components.
